title: Using web components in MDX
astroRange: ^4.0.0

If you have a web component defined in a separate JavaScript file, you can include it in your MDX file by importing the script and adding a `<script>` tag with `type="module"`.
The script will be executed on the client side.

```js title="src/web-component.js"
class MyEl extends HTMLElement { ... }
customElements.define('my-el', MyEl);
```

Then in your `.mdx` file you can import it

```mdx title="src/Page.mdx"
import webComponent from "./web-component.js?url";

<script src={webComponent} type="module"></script>

<my-el />
```
