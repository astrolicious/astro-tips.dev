title: Leverage Zod's power
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference. It's used in many parts
of Astro and can help you achieve more advanced behavior.

A common place where Astronauts want more customization is in the
[Content Collections config](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-collections). We'll look at
3 powerful Zod features that cover a few basic use-cases.

### `preprocess`

People often want a bit more customization when referencing images inside their frontmatter. For instance:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Current">
    ```mdx title="src/content/blog/hello-world.md"
    ---
    title: Hello world
    image: ~/src/assets/blog/hello-world.png
    ---
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Wanted">
    ```mdx title="src/content/blog/hello-world.md"
    ---
    title: Hello world
    image: hello-world.png
    ---
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This can be easily be done using [`preprocess`](https://zod.dev/?id=preprocess)!

```ts title="src/content/config.ts" del={8} ins={9}
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content"

export const collections = {
    blog: defineCollection({
        type: "content",
        schema: ({ image }) => z.object({
            title: z.string(),
            image: image(),
            image: z.preprocess(val => `~/src/assets/blog/${val}`, image()),
        })
    })
}
```

### `transform`

You may not have the data in the shape you want in the frontmatter but you don't want (or can't) change
all your entries. This is where [`transform`](https://zod.dev/?id=transform) comes in! This transform will
allow us to you use those coordinates conveniently with library like `mapbox-gl`:

```ts title="src/content/config.ts" ins={12}
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content"

export const collections = {
    blog: defineCollection({
        type: "content",
        schema: z.object({
            coordinates: z
                .object({
                    latitude: z.number(),
                    longitude: z.number(),
                })
                .transform((e) => [e.longitude, e.latitude] as [number, number])
        })
    })
}
```

### `refine`

You may want to add extra validation to your frontmatter. For example, what if you want to make sure your
images are big enough? Let's have a look at [`refine`](https://zod.dev/?id=refine). You can set a condition
that should be met, and a message that will be shown if not!

```ts title="src/content/config.ts" del={7} ins={8-10}
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content"

export const collections = {
    blog: defineCollection({
        type: "content",
        schema: ({ image }) => z.object({
            image: image(),
            image: image().refine((img) => img.width >= 1080, {
                message: "Cover image must be at least 1080 pixels wide!",
            })
        })
    })
}
```
