See guided examples of adding features to your Astro project, submitted by our community members!

[Astro recipes](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/) are typically short, focused how-to guides that walk a reader through completing a working example of a specific task. Recipes are a great way to add new features or behavior to your Astro project by following step-by-step instructions!

Other guides might explain concepts related to an area of content, such as using images or working with MDX.
