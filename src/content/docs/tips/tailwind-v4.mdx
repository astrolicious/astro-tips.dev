description: Quick set up for trying out Tailwind v4 alpha using the vite plugin
astroRange: ^4.0.0

Tailwind 4.0 plans to introduce some big changes, including a new Vite plugin, which will improve accuracy and performance. 

On top of the Vite plugin v4 comes with some major changes, most notably a redesign of the `tailwind.config.mjs`. The plan is to continue to support using the existing configs, but steer users toward using the entry point `.css` file as the config file. 

:::note
The alpha does not have all the features implemented yet, most notably dark mode other than media queries. Check out the [Tailwind v4.0 Blogpost](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha) for more details.

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Install Tailwind's official Vite plugin

    <AllPackageManagers pkg=" npm install --save-dev tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/vite@next"/>

2. Add the plugin to Astro config and enable Lightning CSS

    ```ts title="astro.config.mjs" {tailwindcss()} ins={2} ins={7}
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';

    // https://astro.build/config
    export default defineConfig({
      vite: {
        plugins: [tailwindcss()],
      }
    });
    ```

3. Import the CSS file that imports Tailwind into your `.astro` components

    Instead of Astro's Tailwind integration importing the default Tailwind `.css` file for you, you'll need to do this yourself. Either import this `.css` file into a shared layout, or into the individual `.astro` components/pages you'd like to use Tailwind in.

    ```css title="src/styles/tailwind.css"
    @import "tailwindcss";
    ```

    ```astro title="src/layouts/Layout.astro" ins={2} "class="max-w-2xl""
    ---
    import "../styles/tailwind.css";
    ---
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <!-- ... -->
      </head>
      <body>
        <article class="max-w-2xl">
          <slot />
        </article>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

</Steps>
