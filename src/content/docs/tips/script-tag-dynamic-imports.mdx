title: Dynamic imports in module scripts
description: How dynamic imports offer granular control over fetch and execution order

Bundled scripts in Astro are automatically processed as [`type="module"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and bundled, which allows for importing and optimal performance. For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#script-processing).

With [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv-launch) (INP) officially replacing [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/articles/fid) (FID), it might seem counterintuitive to suggest replacing a static import inside a module script with a dynamic one. However, this approach can be advantageous in certain scenarios, such as when you need to ensure that a module is executed before initiating the download of another. See MDN's [Dynamic module loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#dynamic_module_loading) documentation for more details.

## Granular control

### Static Imports

Static imports ensure that your code is hydrated and ready to run as soon as possible, without affecting [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/fcp) (FCP) or [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) (LCP). This is important for INP because it ensures that any interactive elements are ready to react to interaction immediately.

### Dynamic module loading

Dynamic imports used in a `type="module"` script, also called dynamic module loading, provide fine-grained control over when your module is imported (downloaded). Since static imports will all be fetched, parsed, and evaluated at the beginning of a module script's execution, importing two expensive modules in the same module script tag can cause delays in the execution of code that only depends on the first module. Dynamic imports allow you to either import a module only when it is needed, or dictate the order of imports allowing for manual optimization of network requests.

### Controlling Network Requests

Dynamic imports also allow you to control the sequence of network requests. Instead of fetching all modules in parallel, which is the default behavior when using multiple static imports or separate module scripts, dynamic imports enable you to ensure that one module is downloaded first before initiating the fetch for the next module. This can be particularly useful when you have modules that are critical for immediate user interaction and others that are less critical or if you are supporting users with very low bandwidth.

## Example

Here's a basic example:


```astro
<script>
  import module1 from '...';
  module1();

  const module2  = await import('...');
  module2();
</script>
```

or

```astro
<script>
  import module1 from '...';
  module1();

  document.addEventListener('some-event', async () => {
    const module2 = await import('...');
    module2();
  });
</script>
```

## Use Cases


### Granular Control
Prioritize critical modules by importing less critical modules only after the critical ones are processed.

```astro
<script>
  import criticalModule from '...';
  criticalModule();

  const lessCriticalModule = await import('...');
  lessCriticalModule();
</script>
```

### Recreate Client Directives in `<script>`s
Effects similar to [`client:visible`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientvisible), [`client:media`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientmedia), and [`client:idle`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientidle) can all be achieved with this technique.

```astro
<script>
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(async (entries, observer) => {
    entries.forEach(async entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        const { module } = await import('...');
        module();
        observer.disconnect();
      }
    });
  });

  observer.observe(document.querySelector('#targetElement'));
</script>

```

### Feature Flags
Dynamically import modules based on feature flags. For example, loading a specific feature only for users who have opted in or who meet certain criteria.

```astro
<script>
  if (featureFlag) {
    const { featureModule } = await import('...');
    featureModule();
  }
</script>
```

### Device-Specific Code
Import desktop-specific code that doesn't need to be downloaded on mobile devices.

```astro
<script>
  (async () => {
    if (!('ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0)) {
      const { desktopModule } = await import('...');
      desktopModule();
    }
  })();
</script>
```

### Rarely Clicked Buttons
A button that might be rarely clicked, and when it is, the module needed to hydrate it is small enough that pre-hydration is unnecessary.

```astro
<script>
  document.querySelector('#rareButton').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    const { buttonModule } = await import('...');
    buttonModule();
  });
</script>
```


## Warning

INP was made an official Core Web Vital for a reason, when a user clicks a button they expect it to react instantly. If you dynamically import heavy code that hydrates a button only when it is clicked that could create a delay between interaction and next paint. Also if you are using this technique to control network requests you are opting out of parallel fetching, which is a feature of `type="module"` so this should only be implemented in special circumstances.
