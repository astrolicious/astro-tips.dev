Scripts with no attributes in Astro are automatically processed into [`type="module"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and all bundled into one `.js` file with static imports. For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#script-processing). It is possible to break code out of that `.js` file and defer what would otherwise be loaded up front by taking advantage of [Dynamic module loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#dynamic_module_loading).

## Examples

```astro
<script>
  import module1 from '...';
  module1();

  const module2  = await import('...');
  module2();
</script>
```

```astro
<script>
  import module1 from '...';
  module1();

  document.addEventListener('some-event', async () => {
    const module2 = await import('...');
    module2();
  });
</script>
```

## Use Cases


### Granular Control
Prioritize critical modules by importing less critical modules only after the critical ones are processed.

```astro
<script>
  import criticalModule from '...';
  criticalModule();

  const lessCriticalModule = await import('...');
  lessCriticalModule();
</script>
```

### Recreate Client Directives in `<script>`s
Effects similar to [`client:visible`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientvisible), [`client:media`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientmedia), and [`client:idle`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientidle) can all be achieved with this technique.

```astro
<script>
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(async (entries, observer) => {
    entries.forEach(async entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        const { module } = await import('...');
        module();
        observer.disconnect();
      }
    });
  });

  observer.observe(document.querySelector('#targetElement'));
</script>

```

### Feature Flags
Dynamically import modules based on feature flags. For example, loading a specific feature only for users who have opted in or who meet certain criteria.

```astro
<script>
  if (featureFlag) {
    const { featureModule } = await import('...');
    featureModule();
  }
</script>
```

### Device-Specific Code
Import desktop-specific code that doesn't need to be downloaded on mobile devices.

```astro
<script>
  (async () => {
    if (!('ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0)) {
      const { desktopModule } = await import('...');
      desktopModule();
    }
  })();
</script>
```

### Rarely Clicked Buttons
A button that might be rarely clicked, and when it is, the module needed to hydrate it is small enough that pre-hydration is unnecessary.

```astro
<script>
  document.querySelector('#rareButton').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    const { buttonModule } = await import('...');
    buttonModule();
  });
</script>
```


## Considerations before using this technique

When a user clicks a button they expect it to react instantly. If you dynamically import heavy code that hydrates a button only when it is clicked that could create a delay between interaction and next paint. 

One benefit of bundling is being able to take more advantage of compression (i.e. gzip or brotli), because as a rule, the larger the file, the better it compresses. That means prematurely splitting a bundle with dynamic imports can lead to bigger download sizes potentially.
