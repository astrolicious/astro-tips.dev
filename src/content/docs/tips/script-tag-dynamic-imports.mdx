import ExampleLinks from '~/components/ExampleLinks.astro'

Scripts with no attributes in Astro are automatically processed into [`type="module"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and all hoisted into one `.js` file that has static imports to other `.js` files with the imported code. It is possible to use [dynamic module loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#dynamic_module_loading) instead of the default static imports, in order to gain more granular control over if/when the imported code is actually imported (downloaded).

For more details on Astro's script processing, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#script-processing).

## Examples

If you want to see a more interactive example that might help explain or let you test things out better you can: 

<ExampleLinks

  githubLink="https://github.com/astrolicious/astro-tips.dev/tree/main/examples/script-tag-dynamic-imports"
/>

### Granular Control

Prioritize critical modules by importing less critical modules only after the critical ones are processed.

```astro
<script>
  import criticalModule from 'criticalModule';
  criticalModule();

  const lessCriticalModule = await import('lessCriticalModule');
  lessCriticalModule();
</script>
```

### Recreate Client Directives in `<script>`s

Effects similar to [`client:visible`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientvisible), [`client:media`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientmedia), and [`client:idle`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientidle) can all be achieved with this technique.

```astro
<script>
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(async (entries, observer) => {
    entries.forEach(async entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        const { module } = await import('module');
        module();
        observer.disconnect();
      }
    });
  });

  observer.observe(document.querySelector('#targetElement'));
</script>

```

### Feature Flags

Dynamically import modules based on feature flags. For example, loading a specific feature only for users who have opted in or who meet certain criteria.

```astro
<script>
  if (featureFlag) {
    const { featureModule } = await import('featureModule');
    featureModule();
  }
</script>
```

### Device-Specific Code

Import desktop-specific code that doesn't need to be downloaded on mobile devices.

```astro
<script>
  (async () => {
    if (!('ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0)) {
      const { desktopModule } = await import('desktopModule');
      desktopModule();
    }
  })();
</script>
```

### Rarely Clicked Buttons

A button that might be rarely clicked, and when it is, the module needed to hydrate it is small enough that pre-hydration is unnecessary.

```astro
<script>
  document.querySelector('#rareButton').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    const { buttonModule } = await import('buttonModule');
    buttonModule();
  });
</script>
```

## Considerations before using this technique

When a user clicks a button they expect it to react instantly. If you dynamically import heavy code that hydrates a button only when it is clicked that could create a delay between interaction and next paint. As a general rule any code that hydrates interactivity shouldn't be delayed.
