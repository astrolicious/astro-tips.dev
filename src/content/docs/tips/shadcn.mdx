title: Setting up Shadcn UI

When working with Astro and ShadCN UI in a project that involves islands architecture, where interactive components in React need to be wrapped individually in `.tsx` files. This is necessary because, with Astro's islands architecture, React context (or state) is not shared across different islands. Each "island" (or separate component) runs in its own isolated environment, so to manage state or context across interactive components, you need to ensure they are self-contained.


## Examples

If you want to see a more interactive example that might help explain or let you test things out better you can:

## Working with Interactive Components

<Steps>

1. Follow the getting started guide from the Shadcn UI documentation to set up the library in your project.

    />

2. Add the Drawer component to your project:

    <AllPackageManagers pkg="npx shadcn@latest add drawer"/>


3. Create a `Drawer` Component in your project:

    ```tsx title="src/components/MyDrawer.tsx"
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
    import {
        Drawer,
        DrawerClose,
        DrawerContent,
        DrawerDescription,
        DrawerFooter,
        DrawerHeader,
        DrawerTitle,
        DrawerTrigger,
    } from "@/components/ui/drawer";

    export const MyDrawer = () => {
        return (
            <Drawer>
                <DrawerTrigger>Open</DrawerTrigger>
                <DrawerContent>
                    <DrawerHeader>
                        <DrawerTitle>Are you absolutely sure?</DrawerTitle>
                        <DrawerDescription>This action cannot be undone.</DrawerDescription>
                    </DrawerHeader>
                    <DrawerFooter>
                        <Button>Submit</Button>
                        <DrawerClose>
                            <Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>
                        </DrawerClose>
                    </DrawerFooter>
                </DrawerContent>
            </Drawer>
        );
    };
    ```
3. Import the `MyDrawer` component in the `src/pages/index.astro` file:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {2,10}
    ---
    import { MyDrawer } from "@/components/MyDrawer"
    import '@/styles/globals.css'
    ---

    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Astro</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <MyDrawer client:load />
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
