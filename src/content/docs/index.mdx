## Why Astro Tips?

[Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build) is a wonderful resource if you have a Astro site. We do suggest to always go there first at see if you find what you are looking for. Astro Tips is born as an addition to Astro Docs, we try to gather more advanced, unusual, experimental, and community written recipes, tutorials, and quick tips.

## How to use Astro Tips?

You have a Astro site and already have something very specific in mind you want to add, e.g. sending emails, adding advanced animations, adding advanced forms. After checking Astro docs for a solution, you can use Astro Tips to find just that. We do have categories and a search for everything we offer.
